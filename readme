DOOM V0.1
  -FLY Gemini v2
  -Dragon HF (0.4mm plated copper nozzle)
  -Orbiter v2 with Mini AS mod
  -CNC parts w/ some Esun ABS+ parts
  -Hiwin rails (def not genuine lol)
  -Leadshine motors (Pretty much no name)
  -Mostly prints ABS+
  
This is the config file for "Craig" my 9th printer and is a doomed out v0.1

THIS IS IMPORTANT PLEASE READ:
  -Leadshine motors are rated at 2a and I have it set to 1.4a, this may damage your motors.
  -The Orbiter v2 has different run_current and rotation_distance than the miniAB
  -The Fly Gemini v2 is not a SKR Mini e3 and does not have the same pinout.
  -This is for me being dumb and losing random stuff
